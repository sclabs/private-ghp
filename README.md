private-ghp
===========

A Flask proxy to serve pages from private repos using OAuth2

Premise
-------

Pointing your browser to

    https://<my_domain>/https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/blob/<ref>/<file_path>

will display the contents of that file in your browser (even if the repo is
private) using your GitHub permissions via OAuth2.

Note that this is achievable by just copy-pasting the full URL to the file when
viewing it in GitHub.

Motivation
----------

GitHub Pages provides a convenient way to host static HTML content related to a
repo (docs, reports, etc.) directly from GitHub. However, it is not possible to
control access to GitHub Pages that belong to private repos unless you have
GitHub Enterprise Cloud. As a workaround, we use OAuth2 to fetch content from a
specified branch of a specified GitHub repo using the user's own permissions.

This project was inspired by [john-dev/private-ghp](https://github.com/john-dev/private-ghp).

Local testing quickstart
------------------------

    git clone https://github.com/sclabs/private-ghp
    cd private-ghp
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_ID=...  # see below
    export PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    python app.py

Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to complete the login flow.

Then navigate to e.g.

http://localhost:5000/https://github.com/sclabs/aotd-graph-d3/blob/master/index.html

to see the file `index.html` from the `master` branch of the
[sclabs/aotd-graph-d3](https://github.com/sclabs/aotd-graph-d3) repo.

Creating the GitHub OAuth App
-----------------------------

[Create a new OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), setting
the Authorization callback URL to `http://localhost:5000/callback` for local
testing, or `https://<your_domain>/callback` for a deployed instance of your
app.

Then generate a client ID and secret for that app and store them as
`PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_ID` and `PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars.

Docker image
------------

The docker image is based on [tiangolo/meinheld-gunicorn-flask](https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/meinheld-gunicorn-flask).

The Docker image is built and published to Docker Hub as
`thomasgilgenast/private-ghp:latest` on every commit to main by GitHub Actions.

You can also build the image locally with

    docker build . -t private-ghp

And to run the image locally at http://localhost:5000

    docker run -d -p 5000:80 \
        -e FLASK_SECRET_KEY=... \
        -e PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_ID=... \
        -e PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
        -e OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1 \
        private-ghp

Note that you need to set `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1` for local testing with
no HTTPS.

Deploy
------

To deploy to gilgi cloud, use the following slack command:

    !cloud deploy ghp thomasgilgenast/private-ghp:latest

Note that for this to work we require the following env vars to be configured in
the gilgi cloud configuration for this subdomain:
 - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
 - `PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_ID`
 - `PRIVATE_GHP_CLIENT_SECRET`
 - `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1`

Note that for gilgi cloud deployment we set `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1`
because SSL is terminated by an nginx reverse proxy upstream of this
application's container.

After the first deploy, you may need to renew the SSL certs by running

    !cloud renew

Compiling dependencies
----------------------

    pip-compile --annotation-style=line
